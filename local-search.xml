    <title>HPRP and Household Consumption</title>

I am still on the search for instrumental variables. I believe it could be an interesting thesis for my PhD studies.</div><h3 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1 Introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h3><div style="text-align: justify">The mid 1990s witnessed a drastic and long-lasting boom in China’s real estate sector.  The hike in housing prices was primarily realized through the following two channels: first, incentivized by enormous fiscal revenue from selling lands to real estate developers, local governments forcefully introduced a series of policies that accelerate the development of housing markets; second, after abandoning the welfare housing system, city residents’ demands on housing hikes. Plus, with the advancements in marketization, the wealth effect of lands and housing also makes them considerably appealing to investors. As a result, housing prices have been skyrocketing: real growth in house prices averages 10% per annum since 2006 (Gyourko et al, 2016).<br><br>While the real estate sector remains a key component of the Chinese economy, the soaring housing prices engender concerns related to the stability of China’s financial system and macro fundamentals, as well as to the welfare of individual household. The authorities have certainly recognized these issues. Since 2005, a series of policies were enacted to regulate the housing market. First introduced in 2010, Housing Purchase Restriction Policy (HPRP) remains one of the most powerful policy tools to curb the soaring housing prices. According to the “NO. 10 National Notice” (2010) issued by the State Council, non-residents (people without registered permanent residency, or “Hukou” ) who paid taxes or social security for less than a year to the city they reside would not be eligible for mortgage loans. It also granted municipalities the authority to control the number of houses or apartments residents and nonresidents can buy. Temporarily relaxed in 2014, HPRP now remains in action in 60 cities.<br><br>There have been plenty of measures and studies on the regulation the housing markets, but most of them target at the supply side. Gyourko and Molloy (2015) has done an impressive work reviewing research on housing supply regulations (outside China), and concluded that based on available evidence, most studies found negative net welfare effects from regulations. Measures that restrict housing demands, however, are rare. In this sense, HPRP is valuable as it serves as a unique social experiment complementing the studies on market regulations. Just like other types of government interventions, HPRP has great implications on social welfare. There exists abundant literature on HPRP and its effects. Most, if not all, focus on its interactions with housing markets. A bulk of research examine the interdependency between HPRP and housing prices (Zhang, 2016). Some research focuses on how HPRP influences housing markets and how these impacts may differ (Du, 2015; Fang, 2018; Cao and Huang, 2015; Cao, 2017; Lu, 2018; Tzur-Ilan, 2016; Fang, 2018; Chen, 2018; Wu, 2016; Wu and Li, 2017). There do exist some attempts evaluating the welfare effects of HPRP, but mostly by building theoretical frameworks (Li, 2011; Hu 2011; Feng and He, 2012). In addition, it is also useful to evaluate the variations in welfare consequences across different groups (Gyourko, 2015). Thus, I am interested in how HPRP reshape the welfare of individual households, especially how the effects might differ across families with distinct characteristics.<br><br>In this study, I intend to measure the net effects of HPRP on household consumption which is a commonly used proxy for welfare (Garner et al, 2003). HPRP is meant to increase the affordability of housings by stifling speculative demands. When housing purchases are restricted, money that is originally spent on housing will then be diverted into either the consumption of other goods or reinvestments on other assets (Mao, 2011). On the other hand, housing also serves as a capital good whose value grows with price. As evaluated by Wu et al (2012), the expected capital gain from housing is quite high in China. As a result, under HPRP, families can no longer invest in the housing market and thus lose one avenue for investing. Decreases in future returns might discourage household consumption. In addition, whether families regard housings as necessities or means of investments should be primarily determined by household characteristics such as financial conditions and preferences. Thus, depending on individual characteristics, influences of HPRP on households vary. There exist several channels via which HPRP introduced differential impacts (Feng and He, 2012). Families owning one or more houses can be driven away from housing to other consumption markets by HPRP. Alternatively, families that have not owned housings and are not eligible for purchase might increase savings. As these forces are in opposite directions, I am curious about the net effects of HPRP on households’ consumption and how these effects vary across groups. Whilst research on the dynamics of housings prices and consumption is plentiful, few are conducted in the context of HPRP (Dong et al, 2017). Moreover, existing researches at best touched on the effects of HPRP from a macro perspective (Zhang, 2016; Du et al, 2015; Lu, 2018). Few analyzes HPRP from a micro level (Mo, 2015). Although there have already been some works on the correlations between HPRP and consumption, they either focus solely on housing markets or use macro-level data (Mo, 2015; Feng and He, 2012). With access to micro-level data on household finance and demographic features, this paper will try to find empirical evidence on how HPRP influences the welfare of individual family.<br><br>Given the dramatic variations in specific terms of HPRP adopted by municipalities, our study focuses on one specific regulation used by nearly all cities – the number of houses a family can purchase given their “Hukou” and housing ownership status, and control for other bundled policies. I also care most about how HPRP influences households’ consumption on goods other than housing, particularly on education and entertainment. Inverse demand system will be used given the fact that HPRP is constraining the quantity of demand, which makes it more appropriate to take quantity as exogenous when analyzing the markets. To compare how the effects of HPRP might differ regarding individual attributes, I will first identify households living in cities that have enforced HPRP, then utilize Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to construct a control group from households (in other regions) not subject to HPRP but with similar characteristics. Several features characterize HPRP as a quasi-experiment: first, cities have some latitude in determining whether to adopt HPRP or not; second, some cities implemented HPRP while others did not; third, eligibility under HPRP can be argued to be exogenous – “Hukou” and number of houses owned were generally determined prior to the HPRP. In order to measure and compare how the results might differ across different types of households, I divide households into three groups based on the attributes of their demands. We are then able to measure the causal relations between HPRP and the consumption of different types of households via a Difference-in-Difference approach (DiD).</div><h3 id="2-Theoretical-framework-and-hypothesis"><a href="#2-Theoretical-framework-and-hypothesis" class="headerlink" title="2 Theoretical framework and hypothesis"></a>2 Theoretical framework and hypothesis</h3><h4 id="2-1-The-loss-of-welfare-induced-by-HPRP"><a href="#2-1-The-loss-of-welfare-induced-by-HPRP" class="headerlink" title="2.1 The loss of welfare induced by HPRP"></a>2.1 The loss of welfare induced by HPRP</h4><div style="text-align: justify">In light of the studies on Harberger Triangle of welfare and the supply and demand model (Glaeser 2003; Hu, 2011; Feng and He, 2012; Canning and Vroomen, 2019), HPRP and its interaction with the housing market can be presented as the following graph.</div><p><img src="/img/g1.png" alt="graph 1"></p><div style="text-align: justify">HPRP restricts housing purchase by a set of regulatory criteria, including “Hukou”, the number of housings owned by households and the amount of down payment. This design is equivalent to dividing up consumer population into groups based on their eligibility. New demands in housing markets are subsamples from each group (Hu, 2011). Thus, the demand curve would shift inward under HPRP (\(D’\) in Graph 1). Notice that for individual households in the same group, their eligibility of housing purchase is the same. I then assume that the “sampling process” within each group is somewhat random. Further notice that I cannot determine the allocation among different groups and its correlations with group characteristics without empirical evidence. That is, I do not make any specific assumptions about the intercept and the slope of \(D’\). In Graph 1, I let \(D’\) have a smaller elasticity compared to \(D\), but it can be just the opposite in reality.<br><br>Technically, HPRP is very likely to induce welfare loss. The welfare loss generated by HPRP is then determined by the slope and intercept of this new curve (Graph 1). Note that \(D’\) represents the new demand curve under HPRP. The deadweight loss (DWL) from HPRP is the polygon BOCF. This DWL is assumed to be greater than a quantity control scenario (denoted by the vertical line AC) by the area of BACF.</div><h4 id="2-2-Inverse-demand-system-of-housing-and-other-goods"><a href="#2-2-Inverse-demand-system-of-housing-and-other-goods" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Inverse demand system of housing and other goods"></a>2.2 Inverse demand system of housing and other goods</h4><div style="text-align: justify">The main idea of this paper is to evaluate the effects of HPRP on household consumption. Specifically, I am interested in what category of consumption will be impacted by HPRP. There are four “outcome” variables of interest: household expenses on education, household expenses on entertainment, household expenses on housing , and total household expenses. Theoretically, HPRP distorts the equilibrium of housing market, shifting the market demand as it puts a cap on the quantity of houses consumers can purchase. With predetermined budget constraints, households will then alter expenses on other goods. It is worth noting that since HPRP targets on the quantity of demand rather than the market prices, individual household takes the quantity (\(Q\)) as given with prices as a function of quantity (\(P(Q)\)). Therefore, I propose to apply inverse demand system in this paper. The inverse demand in housing market can be expressed as:</div><div style="text-align: center"> \(P_D^h=a_D^h-b_D^h Q_D^h+r_D^h X_D^h+ϵ_D^h\) (1)</div><div style="text-align: justify">Where \(P_D^h\) is housing price, \(Q_D^h\) is the quantity, and \(X_D^h\) is a vector of factors that correlated to market prices (i.e. market shifters). In parallel, the inverse supply is:</div><div style="text-align: center"> \(P_S^h=a_S^h+b_S^h Q_S^h+r_S^h X_S^h+ϵ_S^h\) (2)</div><div style="text-align: justify">The equilibrium in housing market can then be calculated by solving for \(P_D = P_S\), which is:</div><div style="text-align: center"> \(Q_h=(a_D^h-a_S^h+r_D^h X_D^h-r_S^h X_S^h+ϵ_D^h-ϵ_S^h)/(b_D^h+b_S^h )\) (3)\(P_h=(b_S^h a_D^h+b_D^h a_S^h+b_S^h r_D^h X_D^h+b_D^h r_S^h X_S^h+b_D^h ϵ_S^h+b_S^h ϵ_D^h)/(b_D^h+b_S^h )\) (4)</div><div style="text-align: justify">Since we assume that demand of education  is under the influence of housing market distortion, the market demand and supply in education market will then be:</div><div style="text-align: center">\(P_D^e=a_D^e-b_D^e Q_D^e-b_D^h Q_D^h+r_D^e X_D^e+ϵ_D^e\) (5)</div><div style="text-align: center">\(P_S^e=a_S^e+b_S^e Q_S^e+r_S^e X_S^e+ϵ_S^e\) (6)</div>Solving for the education market equilibrium gives us the following function:<div style="text-align: center">\(Q_e=A+B_1 X_D^h+B_2 X_S^h+B_3 X_D^e+B_4 X_S^e+ϵ\) (7)</div><div style="text-align: center">\(P_e=Ζ+γ_1 X_D^h+γ_2 X_S^h+γ_3 X_D^e+γ_4 X_S^e+ϵ\) (8)</div><div style="text-align: justify">where \(Q_e\) is the demand of education (or other goods); \(P_e\) is the price of education; \(X_D^h\) is a vector of factors that influence demand of housing; \(X_S^h\) is a vector of factors that influence supply of housing; \(X_D^e\) is a vector of factors that influence demand of education (or other goods); and \(X_S^e\) is a vector of factors that influence supply of education (or other goods). Coefficients \(A, B, Z\) and \(γ\) can be expressed as functions of \(a_D^e,b_D^e,b_D^h,r_D^e\) and etc. Since \(P_e\) and \(Q_e\) are endogenous and correlated to housing market shifters \(X_D^h\) and \(X_S^h\), HPRP and its effects are also endogenous in education markets. Thus, it is not possible to evaluate the causal effects of HPRP on education (or other goods) market with simple linear model.<br><br>Another challenge we are confronting is the selection bias problem. This is resulted from the nature of HPRP: though it was initiated by the central government of P. R. China, municipalities still enjoyed discretions of whether and when to implement it. As a result, cities chose to adopt HPRP (adopter) can be fundamentally different from cities chose not to (non-adopter). For example, adopters are usually more developed and have higher housing prices than non-adopters. Families living in these two types of cities are also different from each other. Such differences can be correlated to their decisions on consumption and thus bias our estimations.<br><br>To address these two issues, I propose to use Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Difference-in-Difference (DID) methods. PSM allows me to construct comparable “treatment” and “control” group based on household-level attributes, which addresses the selection bias issue and lay the ground for DID analysis. DID can then cross out the endogenous factors influencing the market demand as long as these factors have similar trend. For the PSM-DID estimation to be valid, several assumptions should be met:</div><ul><li>The trend of the treatment and control group is parallel.</li><li>The allocation of HPRP does not depend on outcomes of interest.</li><li>No spillover effects of HPRP on control group.</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify">Available data only cover one year before HPRP and two years after. Thus, I argue that the “parallel trend” assumption would hold in such a short timeframe. Moreover, since the outcome variables are essentially the consumption on education and entertainment, and since the municipalities chose to adopt HPRP primarily based on market indicators such as housing prices and cities’ administrative level (capitals of provinces are the first to implement HPRP), it is safe to assume that the allocation of HPRP is not based on household consumption. I further assume that HPRP imposes a parallel shift  to the education demand curve (namely, the intercept \(a_D^e\) is now \(a_D^e+μ\)). Therefore, the education demand of the control and treatment group before and after HPRP would be:</div><div style="text-align: center">\(Q_{D,t_0}^C=A_{t_0}+B_1 X_{D,t_0}^h+B_2 X_{S,t_0}^h+B_3 X_{D,t_0}^e+B_4 X_{S,t_0}^e+ϵ_{t_0}\) (9)</div><div style="text-align: center">\(Q_{D,t_0}^T=C_{t_0}+B_1 X_{D,t_0}^h+B_2 X_{S,t_0}^h+B_3 X_{D,t_0}^e+B_4 X_{S,t_0}^e+ϵ_{t_0}\) (10)</div><div style="text-align: center">\(Q_{D,t_1}^C=A_{t_1}+B_1 X_{D,t_1}^h+B_2 X_{S,t_1}^h+B_3 X_{D,t_1}^e+B_4 X_{S,t_1}^e+ϵ_{t_1}\) (11)</div><div style="text-align: center">\(Q_{D,t_1}^T=C_{t_1}+B_1 X_{D,t_1}^h+B_2 X_{S,t_1}^h+B_3 X_{D,t_1}^e+B_4 X_{S,t_1}^e+ϵ_{t_1}\) (12)</div><div style="text-align: justify">Under the assumptions above, we have \(A_{t_0 }=A_{t_1 }=A(b_D^h,b_D^e,b_S^h,b_S^e)\), while \(C_{t_0 }=C(b_D^h,b_D^e,b_S^h,b_S^e)\) and \(C_{t_1}=C(b_D^h,b_D^e,b_S^h,b_S^e,μ)\). I am also assuming that the changes in \(X_D^h,X_S^h,X_D^e,X_S^e\) (observables) and \(ϵ_{t_1}\) (unobservables) across time are the same between the treatment and control group, so they will get crossed out when we do DID analysis. By adding \(X_D^h,X_S^h,X_D^e,X_S^e\) in the DID regression, we can soften the parallel assumption on the observables. However, the unobservables might still bias the estimations if they do not have parallel trend. Thus, it is critical to include the “correct” controls and to interpret the unobservables as having similar trend. As a result, the DID estimator is essentially:</div><div style="text-align: center">\(DID=(Q_{D,t_1}^T-Q_{D,t_0}^T )-(Q_{D,t_1}^C-Q_{D,t_0}^C)=C_{t_1 }-C_{t_0 }=C(b_D^h,b_D^e,b_S^h,b_S^e,μ)\) (13)</div><div style="text-align: justify">This measure partly serves my intention of doing causal inference on HPRP and household consumption. However, what we are really interested in should be the size of \(μ\). A possible solution is to use instrumental variables for HPRP. I am currently on the search for instruments, and the following two occur to me as plausible options: the supply of land and geographical measures such as terrains or elevations.</div><h3 id="3-Descriptive-Statistics-and-PSM"><a href="#3-Descriptive-Statistics-and-PSM" class="headerlink" title="3 Descriptive Statistics and PSM"></a>3 Descriptive Statistics and PSM</h3><div style="text-align: justify">The data I use for this research come from two sources: the first one is China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) offered by Peking University and the second one is a city-level dataset collected by me and a small group of students from Renmin University of China. CFPS is a survey carried out every two years. Thus, it is important to determine whether the data was collected before or after the introduction of HPRP. As shown in the following timetable (Table 1), it is safe to interpret data of 2010 as “before” the implementation of HPRP and 2012 – 2014 as “after”.  Then two steps are taken to perform PSM:Step 1: probit model is used to estimate the probability (or the “propensity score”) of each household to be “adopters” of HPRP.<div style="text-align: center">\(p_i=Prob[HPRP=1|X]\) (14)</div>Here \(p_i\) is the probability/propensity of family \(i\), and \(X\) denotes a vector of controls representing family attributes.Step 2: I then use Kernel-based Matching (KBM) method to match each family in treatment group to several families (with different weights) in control groups. The radius of matching is 0.025.</div><p><img src="/img/table1.png" alt="table1"></p><div style="text-align: justify">With matched treatment and control groups, I then perform DID analysis and estimate the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT). Besides this PSM-DID approach, I also use the fixed effect model to estimate the impacts of HPRP as a robustness check.<br><br>For PSM-DID model, I drop observations from Beijing to ensure that we have a neat sample containing information from both “before” and “after” HPRP. This gives me a sample size of 8921 from 124 cities, half of which have adopted HPRP. Families are matched using data of 2010 so that the effects of HPRP would not distort the matching. The treatment is HPRP, and families ever living in cities adopting HPRP are allocated in the treatment group. Other families are then automatically grouped in the control group. Prior to matching, t-test is run to determined if the treatment and control group have significantly different attributes (including hukou status, household head age, family size and number of housing owned by the family etc.). Results are presented in Table 2. In short, families in the treatment and control group are different, so without any adjustment, a direct estimation using these data will be subject to selection bias.</div><p><img src="/img/table2.png" alt="table2"></p><div style="text-align: justify">I then perform PSM based on the family level controls. KBM is used to match families in treatment group with families in control group. With KBM, every “untreated” observation will be assigned different weights and used to construct the control group, which allow for the inclusion of more information in later regression. Table 3 presents the balance test results after matching. All attributes are balanced, so the matching is successful.</div><p><img src="/img/table3.png" alt="table3"></p><h3 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h3><div style="text-align: justify">Breslaw, J. and Smith, B.

    <title>Videos on Inverse Demand System</title>
    <link href="undefined2019/08/11/ids/"/>
    <url>2019/08/11/ids/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Inverse demand system is the inverse function of the traditional demand system. It is rather valuable for empirical research (Hicks, 1956; Baker and Bresnahan, 1988; Barten and Bettendorf, 1989; Kim, 1997). However, there lacks straight-forward illustration of inverse demand system. Thus, I made these videos primarily based on the work of Kim (1997), talking about the duality of inverse demand function and the normal demand function, as well as the welfare measures (namely compensating and equivalent variation) in the inverse demand system. I also elaborate a bit on the empirical application of these two demand functions.</p><p>Note: I apply this model in my paper on House-Purchase Restriction Policy.</p><p><strong>Please follow the links below to watch the videos.</strong></p><ol><li>Inverse Demand System: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quP6k0Tf9n8&t=414s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the basic idea and a simple example</a>;</li><li>Inverse Demand System: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lziGScipZ0&t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">welfare measures (CV &amp; EV)</a>;</li><li>Inverse Demand System: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bx6ntuny-g&t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">empirical application (a general discussion)</a>.</li></ol><p>I referred to the following 2 paper to make the videos:<br>Kim, H.Y. 1997.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This a short review of <strong><em>Trumponomics</em></strong> by <strong>Stephen Moore &amp; Arthur B. Laffer</strong>.</p><p>这本书是2018年出的，特朗普竞选团队的经济学家试图向大家系统地解释一系列政策背后的逻辑。写法上相当随意，很多时候想到哪写到哪，政治色彩非常强，所以自始自终不太能说服我。</p><p>在这本书里特朗普被描绘成了一个遗世独立的政治天才，有绝佳的经济和政治直觉，在promoting这件事上极具天赋。而与之相对的奥巴马和希拉里则更像是趾高气昂、不顾普通民众死活的政治精英，一意孤行地推着一堆注定失败的政策。</p><p>撇去内容不谈（逻辑陷阱太多了，估计这本书最大的目的也不是要让大家相信特朗普那一套真的完美无缺），这本书给我最大的感触是，我们确实迎来了一个变革与转向的时代：“政治正确”的含义改变了，特朗普反绿色运动、反全球化、反自由贸易，拥护民粹、国家主义，基本是一个彻头彻尾“政治不正确”的人。但就算书里所有的经济学狡辩都是错的，它至少说对了一件事，那就是他赢了，确确实实地获得了大部分美国人的支持。</p><p>这种支持很好理解，现在美国大部分人，包括商人、政客、学者，都是冷战时期成长起来的。但对于我们来说，这种对特朗普的支持最大的问题就是中国的国际形象和地位在他们看来不是正面的，而我们自身的实力还负担不起这种带有敌意的眼光。</p><p>联想到民粹掌权的意大利、默克尔下台后的德国、还有一团乱麻的英国，我只觉得世界的风向正在转弯，但没有人知道下一个阶段新的righteousness会是什么，大概特朗普们自己都不知道。</p><p>题外话：这本书推荐给喜欢追星并给偶像写小论文的人，看了你就知道，原来崇拜和溜须拍马还可以这么高级。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This a short review of <strong><em>The Courage to Act: A Memoir of A Crisis and Its Aftermath</em></strong> by <strong>Ben Bernanke</strong>.</p><ol><li><p>This book solves a lot of puzzles on central banking for me. The first one coming into my mind should be the “boundary issue”. On the one hand, central banks should maintain its nonpartisan stance so that it can “moves” the market objectively. On the other hand, it is also the responsibility of central bankers to coordinate the economic policies and make sure everything is in alignment of the policy targets. In addition, should we expect the central banks to foresee systematic risks and acts as a safety net when crises hit the economy?</p></li><li><p>It seems that the priority of monetary policy making is to consider what the change in policy could do to the market expectation. Quote Mr. Bernanke, 98% of the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on communication with the market. However, examples offered in the book (such as the implementation of quantitative easing and the rescue of )</p></li><li><p>I was always wondering if it is rational to use “cycle” to explain the booms and busts of literally every macroeconomic phenomenon, and use this line of logic to forecast the future. Does history really repeat itself? Mr. Bernanke did mention this question in his book, though he simply quoted Mark Twain that “history may rhyme, but does not repeat itself”. So now the question becomes: to what extent would history rhyme?</p></li><li><p>The fuses of crises often seem to be bank runs (though in different forms). So what is the root of crises? What makes the market panic at the very beginning? Is there a factor that can conclude these panics?</p></li></ol>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This a short review of <strong><em>Norse Mythology</em></strong> by <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong>.</p><p>还是GAIMAN的书。薄薄的一本，和美国众神风格迥异，但说实话我更喜欢这本书。</p><p>Odin为了获得无与伦比的智慧付出了一只眼睛；Hel是Loki和女巨人的女儿；Thor的锤子Mjollnir是矮人工匠打造的，但是由于Loki从中作梗，锤柄短了一截。还有智慧的Kvasir、能够返老还童的Idunn、除了Loki没人不喜欢的Balder……整本书基本上就是一个北欧神话科普，但我还不确定这些故事是GAIMAN瞎编的还是真实口耳相传下来的。</p><p>很有趣的是，在GAIMAN的想象里，没有十全十美的神祗，他们和凡人一样狡诈、自私、贪生怕死。最后关于诸神黄昏的描写特别酷，Loki和他的三个私生子组成军队向诸神宣战，最终的结局是大家同归于尽，连太阳都陨落了。但最终的最终，一切又得以重新开始，Balder和Hod重生，带着侥幸活下来的孩子们下棋。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This a short review of <strong><em>American Gods</em></strong> by <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong>.</p><p>这是一个关于混乱和矛盾的故事，古老的神正渐渐被世界淡忘，而新的神：城市、高速公路、媒体和电子游戏正当其道。奥丁找到了自己遗落在凡间的儿子shadow，让他帮助自己笼络旧神，与“世界先生”带领的新神开战。可影子到最后才发现，这一切竟然只是以死亡为食的奥丁的阴谋，和他合谋的就是伪装成世界先生、以混乱为食的洛基。</p><p>GAIMAN在后记里写，他一直担心有人会质疑他作为一个英国人，怎么敢狂妄地试图描绘出一个关于美国的土生土长的故事。但我觉得他做得挺好的，美国本身就是一个新旧、内外混杂矛盾的国家，是殖民者最成功的作品，这种特点贯穿了整个故事：神明不再高高在上，反而有着许多普通人也有的脆弱和烦恼。没有什么是永恒的，除了变化本身；没有什么是完美的，最完美的东西往往最无用；也没有什么是不死的，人人皆可死，神亦可死，但这片土地和它孕育的生命永远存在、永无止息。</p><p>看完这本书才知道原来已经有人拿它当剧本拍出东西来了，可看了一个预告我就失望了。这本书远不止要讲一个奇幻炫目的故事，它还想表达一种理解，一种旁观者对一类文明、一个国家的理解。</p>]]></content>
