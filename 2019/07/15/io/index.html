            <p><em>This is an independent research paper. I have submitted it to China Economic Review.</em></p>
<p>There are rich literature studying the effects of inequality. However, empirical research often reach inconsistent conclusions. Following the work of Roemer (1992), I argue that inequality can be decomposed, and its components have diverging impacts. The concept of inequality of opportunity (IO) as an alternative measure of inequality is proposed by both economists and sociologists (Winslow, 1952; Dworkin, 1981; Sen, 1985). Formerly defined by Roemer (1993), IO stands for inequality induced by factors (or circumstances) beyond the control of individuals, including gender, race, parents’ attributions, etc., while another source of inequality (inequality of effort, or IE) emerge from differences in individual efforts or subjective choices such as occupations and investments in education. Blume and Durlauf (2001) buttressed this idea in their book, arguing that the persistence of inequality is attributable to the circumstances. Other scholars empirically applied IO to evaluate its effects on diverse socioeconomic topics like economic growth (Marrero and Rodriguez, 2013; Bradbury and Triest, 2016), investments in human capital (Mejia and St-Pierre, 2008; Song and Zhou, 2019) and emergence of child labor (Emerson and Knabb, 2005). In short, IO levies negative impacts on the wellbeing of society.</p>
<p>In this paper, I intend to empirically test the effects of IO on social stability in China. With access to national census data of 2005, I construct a measure of IO on county level. I then merge the county-level data of publicized mass incidents to census data and test the correlations between IO and both the occurrence and frequency of mass incidents. It proves that IO does positively correlated with the happening of mass incidents. Namely, in counties with greater IO, there are both a higher probability and more records of mass incidents. The results hold in both robustness tests I perform subsequently – one is to employ another measure of IO, the other is to aggregate the data to provincial level. I also examine mechanism through which IO could impact the stability of society. In particular, hukou seems to play a momentous role in passing on the effects of IO to social stability. Regions with higher ratio of floating population (defined as residents without local hukou) suffer from more incidents of social unrests. It can be inferred from this finding that people might care more about the egalitarian distributions of social rights such as accessing resources of education and social security. This is because hukou is often used as a threshold determining who get the priority in the distributions of (some) public goods.</p>
<p>My work contributes to the existing body of literature in the following ways. Frist of all, to the best of my knowledge, though a bulk of analysis can be found on inequality and/or IO and the socioeconomic effects, there still lacks research directly examine the relationship between IO and mass incidents. This paper, as a result, serves to fill this gap of knowledge. Second, this is amongst the first attempts to use county-level data of China to study IO. It is also one of the first studies on the effects of IO on social stability with social unrests data of China. In comparison to research whose scope expands beyond counties, my paper avoids potential biases introduced by the distinctions in history, culture and political institutions among countries. I also examine the heterogeneous nature of IO across region by grouping counties based on economic features such as GDP per capita, fiscal expenditure and shares of three sectors. Results indicate that IO in general has greater effects on more underdeveloped areas. Third, this paper is one of the first attempts exploring mechanisms via which IO rather than inequality sways social stability. I assess channels through which IO could alter the happening of mass incidents, and determine one possible explanation for the positive correlation: in counties with higher level of IO, there is also a larger size of floating population. Moreover, counties with higher share of floating population suffer from substantially greater probabilities and frequencies of mass incidents.</p>
