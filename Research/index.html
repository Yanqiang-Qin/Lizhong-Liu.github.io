<div style="text-align: justify">It is no news that Germany is at the brink of another technical recession. This blog post is trying to decompose the reasons for the plunge in German's economic growth since 2018 from a comparative perspective. Specifically, I try to make comparisons between Germany and France, especially their economic performance since 2018, and dig out the root of German's recession.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Inverse demand system is the inverse function of the traditional demand system. It is rather valuable for empirical research (Hicks, 1956; Baker et al, 1988; Barten et al, 1989; Kim, 1997). However, there lacks straight-forward illustration of inverse demand system. Thus, I made these videos primarily based on the work of Kim (1997), talking about the duality of inverse demand function and the normal demand function, as well as the welfare measures (namely compensating and equivalent variation) in the inverse demand system. I also elaborate a bit on the empirical application of these two demand functions.

Note: I apply this model in my paper on House-Purchase Restriction Policy.</div>

Ongoing.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify">Housing is one of the most important component to China's economy. However, the soaring housing prices engender concerns related to the stability of China’s financial system and macro fundamentals, as well as to the welfare of individual household. In order to curb the surging housing prices, a series of policies were introduced by the government, targeting at both the demand and the supply side. Amongst of these policy tools, House-Purchase Restriction Policy (HPRP, or ["Xiangou"](http://wiki.china.org.cn/wiki/index.php/Purchase_restriction_order)) is unique. It specifies that people without local [“Hukou”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system) and paying taxes for less than a year to the city they reside would not be eligible for mortgage loans. It also granted municipalities the authority to control the number of houses or apartments residents and nonresidents can buy. Temporarily relaxed in 2014, HPRP now remains in action in 60 cities. Interested in how such a policy disturb the housing market and reshape household behavior, I propose to construct an inverse demand system of housing and other goods, and apply a PSM-DiD method to evaluate the impacts of HPRP on household consumption, specifically the consumption of education and entertainment. Two sources of data are used: one is household survey data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), and the other is a database collected and organized by me and a small team of students from Renmin University of China. This database covers 70 cities, dates from 2001 to 2017 and includes a wide range of city-level economic and housing market attributes. This will be the first project of a paper series which delineates the welfare effects of untraditional demand-side policy (those "regulating" the quantity rather than the price).</div>

<h2 id="Inequality-of-Opportunity-and-Social-Stability-Evidence-from-China"><a href="#Inequality-of-Opportunity-and-Social-Stability-Evidence-from-China" class="headerlink" title="Inequality of Opportunity and Social Stability: Evidence from China"></a><strong>Inequality of Opportunity and Social Stability: Evidence from China</strong></h2><p>Liu, L. 2019. Beijing. (forthcoming)</p>
<div style="text-align: justify">There are rich literature studying the effects of inequality. However, empirical research often reach inconsistent conclusions. Following the work of Roemer (1992), I argue that inequality can be decomposed, and its components have diverging impacts. The concept of inequality of opportunity (IO) as an alternative measure of inequality is proposed by both economists and sociologists (Winslow, 1952; Dworkin, 1981; Sen, 1985). Formerly defined by Roemer (1993), IO stands for inequality induced by factors (or circumstances) beyond the control of individuals, including gender, race, parents’ attributions, etc., while another source of inequality (inequality of effort, or IE) emerge from differences in individual efforts or subjective choices such as occupations and investments in education. Blume and Durlauf (2001) buttressed this idea in their book, arguing that the persistence of inequality is attributable to the circumstances. Other scholars empirically applied IO to evaluate its effects on diverse socioeconomic topics like economic growth (Marrero and Rodriguez, 2013; Bradbury and Triest, 2016), investments in human capital (Mejia and St-Pierre, 2008; Song and Zhou, 2019) and emergence of child labor (Emerson and Knabb, 2005). In short, IO levies negative impacts on the wellbeing of society.
<br><br>
In this paper, I intend to empirically test the effects of IO on social stability in China. With access to national census data of 2005, I construct a measure of IO on county level. I then merge the county-level data of publicized mass incidents  to census data and test the correlations between IO and both the occurrence and frequency of mass incidents. It proves that IO does positively correlated with the happening of mass incidents. Namely, in counties with greater IO, there are both a higher probability and more records of mass incidents. The results hold in both robustness tests I perform subsequently – one is to employ another measure of IO, the other is to aggregate the data to provincial level. I also examine mechanism through which IO could impact the stability of society. In particular, hukou seems to play a momentous role in passing on the effects of IO to social stability. Regions with higher ratio of floating population (defined as residents without local hukou) suffer from more incidents of social unrests. It can be inferred from this finding that people might care more about the egalitarian distributions of social rights such as accessing resources of education and social security. This is because hukou is often used as a threshold determining who get the priority in the distributions of (some) public goods.  
<br><br>
My work contributes to the existing body of literature in the following ways. Frist of all, to the best of my knowledge, though a bulk of analysis can be found on inequality and/or IO and the socioeconomic effects, there still lacks research directly examine the relationship between IO and mass incidents. This paper, as a result, serves to fill this gap of knowledge. Second, this is amongst the first attempts to use county-level data of China to study IO. It is also one of the first studies on the effects of IO on social stability with social unrests data of China. In comparison to research whose scope expands beyond counties, my paper avoids potential biases introduced by the distinctions in history, culture and political institutions among countries. I also examine the heterogeneous nature of IO across region by grouping counties based on economic features such as GDP per capita, fiscal expenditure and shares of three sectors. Results indicate that IO in general has greater effects on more underdeveloped areas. Third, this paper is one of the first attempts exploring mechanisms via which IO rather than inequality sways social stability. I assess channels through which IO could alter the happening of mass incidents, and determine one possible explanation for the positive correlation: in counties with higher level of IO, there is also a larger size of floating population. Moreover, counties with higher share of floating population suffer from substantially greater probabilities and frequencies of mass incidents.</div>

Programming Class Project. Chicago.<br><a href="https://github.com/Lizhong-Liu/GFPP_DiD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github site</a></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) is an initiative first implemented by Los Angeles in 2012. Public schools are the main bodies adopting this policy. The main idea is to procure meals from local food business and apply harsher standards of nutrition, raw material sources and environmental influences. GFPP has five value criteria: animal welfare, nutrition, support for local business, rights of employees (such as safety and justice), and environmental sustainability. This project aims to identify the effects of this program on local socioeconomic development. As GFPP has been marked as a priority in several other cities, including Austin, Chicago, Cincinnati, Oakland and Twin Cities, and there lack quantitative evaluation of the program, our project can serve as a reference for these other cities in the potential outcomes of GFPP.
<br><br>
Specifically, we employed data on public schools from California Department of Education. We treat public schools in LA county as "the treated", and use the others as the control group. Then using Difference-in-Difference analysis, we attempt to find the causal relations between the implementation of GFPP and the health outcomes of public school students. Based on the regression results, we conclude that It has not been demonstrated obvious benefits on students' physical fitness resulting from the GFPP yet. However, it does not necessarily mean that GFPP does not have any impacts on students' health. As a matter of fact, nutrition-related policies usually have more significant influences on the health outcomes of younger children and children from poorer families. In fact, given that Los Angeles is well-developed and has been implementing GFPP only for 4 years, our results are not especially surprising. Unfortunately, due to the limited data and time we have, we fail to conduct more rigorous quantitative analysis and refine our project.</div>
